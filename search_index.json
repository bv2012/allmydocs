DEVSECOPS?","keywords":"","body":"WHAT IS DEVSECOPS?\nThe Need For DevSecOps\nTo understand what DevSecOps is, let's begin with the question \"Why should we care about it?\". What better way to answer this question than narrating a few stories which will help you understand the impact of what happens in its absence:\n\nIn 2016, attackers breached Uber’s system and stole the personal information of approximately 57 million users across the globe. The breached data included location history, credit card and bank account details, social security numbers, dates of birth, etc. This breach, followed by the subsequent cover-up, resulted in Uber paying $148 million in penalty. The root cause for this breach was a bug in the API.\nIn 2017, a well-known and unpatched vulnerability in the underlying framework used by an application deployed by Equifax, a credit reporting agency, resulted in attackers stealing sensitive data, including the personal and financial information of millions of people. This resulted in Equifax paying more than $575 million in settlement. The root cause of this breach was an unpatched vulnerability in a component used by the software.\nA known vulnerability in Kubernetes allowed attackers to escalate privileges, break out of a container, and gain root access to the underlying host. This could have a wider impact worldwide with all the unpatched Kubernetes installations, as Kubernetes is the gold standard in the world of container-based deployments. Your systems would be vulnerable had you not patched/updated Kubernetes.\n\nDo we need to emphasize more why it is crucial to incorporate security into the software delivery process?\nWell, the good news is that DevSecOps practices can help you manage most issues similar to the ones mentioned above by helping you detect such risks early, make you aware of the impact, and push you to fix them before the issue blows out of proportion in a production environment. In some cases, these practices can even help you automatically mitigate concerns by patching/updating the application infrastructure. And this is why you should care about DevSecOps.\nThe Path that Led to DevSecOps\nThe Waterfall Model\nNow, let’s look at the path that led to DevSecOps. This should help you better understand how software development and delivery models evolved over the years.\nThe most popular model used for developing and delivering software resembles a waterfall and involves moving from one step to another in the following sequence:\n.png>)\nThe Waterfall Model: Requirements, Design, Implementation, Verification, Maintenance\\\n\\\nThis model commonly results in longer deployment cycles, longer feedback loops, a significant amount of rework, and a slower pace of delivery overall.\nAgile Methodologies\nHenry Ford’s assembly line sped up the process of manufacturing, which was then iterated and perfected by Toyota with the so-called Toyota Production System (TPS). This system undoubtedly transformed automobile manufacturing.\nIterative Development\nThe principles and practices that evolved as part of this system, including \"just-in-time\" production, continuous feedback, and improvement (Kaizen), were then adapted by the wider manufacturing industry and, later, the software industry. This led to the development of Lean IT and, subsequently, to the creation of the Agile Manifesto in 2001, which resulted in development processes being sped up significantly.\nDevOps\nUsing agile methodologies, developers were able to build software faster, in smaller chunks and in an iterative fashion, with less reworking. They were also able to fix issues and create patches much more quickly. However, traditional operations teams that had adopted the agile principles were, in fact, left out of the development loop. While developers were more concerned about the speed of delivery, for operations teams, reliability was of foremost importance, which created their reluctance toward frequent deployments, along with reduced preparedness and a lack of tooling to support the same.\\\nDevOps Model\nA set of principles, practices and tools which emerged to solve these problems came to be known as the DevOps practices. These ultimately resulted in the realization of the two conflicting goals of achieving faster delivery without compromising the reliability of the software. DevOps greatly relies on a set of automation tools that echo the assembly line in manufacturing. Today, DevOps represents the de facto practices used by organizations across the globe.\nDevSecOps\nHowever, even with DevOps, the aspect of security remained unresolved. While you could improve the speed of deployment without compromising the reliability of the software using DevOps, the software development ended up either being slowed down due to security practices (which are implemented toward the end of the delivery pipeline) or having vulnerabilities that often leak into the production environment. DevOps could help patch these vulnerabilities quickly, but the ideal solution would have been to make the code secure without compromising the speed of delivery. This is what led to the creation of the principles, practices, and tools referred to as DevSecOps. DevSecOps is an organic extension of DevOps and follows a similar approach for implementation.\nSo, let us summarize why we need DevSecOps:\n\nDevOps enables fast deployments with high reliability.\nTraditional security cannot keep pace with it.\n\nTherefore, the solution is to incorporate security into the DevOps practices. This approach is what we know as DevSecOps.\n\n"},"lfs262-implementing-devsecops/what-is-devsecops/devsecops.html":{"url":"lfs262-implementing-devsecops/what-is-devsecops/devsecops.html","title":"DevSecOps","keywords":"","body":"DevSecOps\nWhat is DevSecOps?\nDevSecOps commonly refers to the set of practices that are incorporated into the software delivery pipeline to provide early feedback on security risks and help you mitigate those risks before even delivering the software.

Monoliths are difficult to maintain and scale, and are less flexible. \nModern software is typically broken down into functionalities, and each functionality is designed and deployed as an individual service (also called a microservice). For example, an e-commerce application can be broken down into functions such as the user interface, product catalog, shopping cart, payments processing, delivery tracking, etc. Each of these can operate as their own microservice, with its own databases having the ability to store its state.\\\nMicroservice Architecture, by Paul Downey, retrieved from Flickr, licensed under CC BY 2.0\nSome advantages of microservices include the following: \n\nScalability\\\nMicroservices are typically stateless and are easier to scale. High availability and scalability are easier to achieve when deploying microservices. \nFlexibility\\\nEach service can be owned, designed, and developed by its own team, and each team would have the flexibility to use the language of their choice.\n\nAPI/Queue-Based Communication\nWhen you break down services into different components and run them as separate microservices, you also need to consider how they would communicate with each other. Modern microservices applications communicate with each other using either of the following:\n\nAsynchronous messaging\\\nUsing message queues with protocols such as AMQP\nSynchronous messaging\\\nUsing protocols such as HTTP/HTTPS, typically as a Representational State Transfer (REST) style architectural plan. REST applications use HTTP methods such as GET, POST, DELETE, and PUT, although not all HTTP-based APIs are RESTful. You can read this article for further information, \"What Are REST APIs? HTTP API vs REST API\".\n\nMost modern applications use REST-based API communication to talk to each other.\nPackaged and Distributed as Container Images\nWhen it comes to packaging and running microservices applications, it is best to use container images. Containers offer a lightweight subsystem to package and run applications with very little (insignificant) overload, and are designed to run one application per container. This perfectly complements the concept of microservices.\nContainer images are also optimized in terms of size by stripping away all the unnecessary components of the underlying root filesystem. Moreover, with the tooling available as part of the open container ecosystem, it is easy to package a microservices-based application into a container image and distribute it using a container registry such as Docker Hub.\nDeployed and Run with Kubernetes\nAs an extension of container runtimes and packaging tools, such as Docker, certain systems were created to orchestrate containers on a multitude of servers. These systems are typically called container orchestration engines, a popular example of which is Kubernetes.\nWhen you want to run containers at scale in a production-like environment, Kubernetes takes all the nodes (VMs, physical, and cloud servers) that are configured as container runtimes, forms a logical entity that appears to be a single cluster to the user, and handles the launching, connecting, and managing of containers in this environment. It offers the following features, and more, which are desirable when running your application in a production environment:\n\nHigh availability\nScalability\nAbility to dynamically route traffic (ingress)\nAbility to network between containers that run on different hosts\nService discovery\nLoad balancing\nAbility to run different workloads: stateful, stateless, CronJobs, etc.\n\nWhile microservices, API-based communications, and containerization make it easy to develop and run applications efficiently and at scale, these technologies also introduce new risks that need to be understood to enable the formulation of a holistic strategy for implementing DevSecOps. Some of these risks will be discussed next.\n"},"lfs262-implementing-devsecops/what-is-devsecops/application-security-risks.html":{"url":"lfs262-implementing-devsecops/what-is-devsecops/application-security-risks.html","title":"Application Security Risks","keywords":"","body":"Application Security Risks\nWhat Are the Risks with Modern Applications?\nTraditionally, when applications were built as monoliths and deployed in data centers, limiting physical access and setting up firewalls would provide sufficient security. With the advent of cloud computing, security measures have been expanded to further implement policies associated with virtual private clouds (VPCs), network access control (NAC), and identity and access management (IAM).\nRunning modern applications on the cloud—which are exposed as APIs, designed as microservices, packaged with containers, and deployed with Kubernetes—introduces new dimensions of risk. Microservices open many perimeters (for many services), have a flexible flow and are constantly/rapidly deployed, which make it even more challenging to address security issues associated with them.\nNext, we will present some tales of caution that should help you put things in perspective.\nAPI/Application Vulnerabilities\n\nA researcher found a way to take over a user account of any Uber driver (Issue 49: Uber account takeover and the leaky Get API - API Security News)\nResearchers detected vulnerabilities with electric vehicle (EV) charging stations, using which they could obtain users' personal information and take control of the charging, possibly causing spikes in charge or mass attacks (Issue 145: APIs and electric car charging stations, The Nuts and Bolts of OAuth 2.0 - API Security News)\nA vulnerability in the iPhone’s automatic call recorder application could expose users’ call recordings and sensitive information (Issue 125: iPhone call recorder API flaw, Burp and OpenAPI, GraphQL pentesting, FAPI - API Security News).\n\nYou can read about many such vulnerabilities at API Security Articles, News, Vulnerabilities & Best Practices.\nPlatform Vulnerabilities\nIn the 2017 Equifax breach, private information such as credit ratings, of 147 million Americans was leaked due to a known vulnerability in a third-party software, i.e. Apache Struts. The root cause for the breach was attributed to this software not being updated for a few months, despite a fix being available (2017 Equifax data breach - Wikipedia).\nA vulnerability was discovered with runC that would allow containers to break out and gain root access on the underlying host in some cases. This affected most of the container environments running Docker and Kubernetes, with runC being the most common low-level container runtime.\nCertain Kubernetes vulnerabilities were discovered in the past that could allow attacks such as denial of service (read Top 5 Kubernetes Vulnerabilities of 2019 — the Year in Review | StackRox Community. Also find out the recent Kubernetes CVEs).\nFor more information about API security, see API Security? Yep, everything you needed to know about that in 6,252 words | Ping Identity.\nThe point here is that modern applications need a holistic and layered approach toward security and need everyone’s involvement, including that of the application developers.\nFrom the web application security perspective, one important resource is the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP), which is an online community that produces resources such as articles, methodologies, even tools and technologies in the field of application security.\n"},"lfs262-implementing-devsecops/what-is-devsecops/defence-in-depth.html":{"url":"lfs262-implementing-devsecops/what-is-devsecops/defence-in-depth.html","title":"Defence-in-Depth","keywords":"","body":"Defence-in-Depth\nLayers of an Onion Approach to Security\nWhile analyzing DevSecOps, it is hardly useful to look at applications or infrastructure in isolation. The threat landscape changes when you add layers such as clouds or a container orchestrator. Therefore, you should examine all the layers involved and take steps to mitigate possible risks accordingly.\nConsider the example of an application running in a Kubernetes environment that is hosted on the cloud, which is a common use case with cloud native applications. In such a scenario, you need to consider implementing security policies for the following layers:\n.png)The Onion Approach\n\nLayers to consider when it comes to security\n\nApplication Layer\nA typical API-based application is prone to many vulnerabilities (refer to OWASP Top 10 choices). Regardless of how strong your infrastructure security is, unless application developers follow best practices while writing the code, the application will be susceptible to threats, more of which are being discovered every day. In addition, you would have to consider the vulnerabilities of the components involved, such as the libraries that your application is built with, and the way in which secret information is provided to the application. Many practices that are implemented as part of the delivery pipeline, such as  static analysis, dynamic analysis, and software composition analysis, can help you build applications that have a minimum number of vulnerabilities.\n\nContainer Images Layer\nWhile packaging applications, it is common to use base images that are available on public registries. Some of these images have vulnerabilities and lack the latest patches, and many run as root. All of these factors could render your infrastructure vulnerable to attacks. Optimizing the container images, setting up automated scans, and using best security practices (e.g., not running applications as root) can mitigate many such risks.\n\nContainer Runtime/Kernel Layer\nContainer runtime misconfigurations or assigning excess privileges could lead to threats such as container breakouts. As container runtimes essentially use kernel features such as namespaces and cgroups to implement software containers, it is crucial to look into how the kernel can be secured. Using secure container runtimes and configuring security-related parameters related to the runtime and kernel would help you secure this layer.\n\nContainer Orchestration/Kubernetes Layer\nAlong with the container runtime, you must consider the container orchestration engine, which most often would be Kubernetes. Kubernetes schedules containers, maintains high availability and scalability, connects applications and provides outside users with access to the same. Considering the significant sophistication of the Kubernetes system, the scope of securing it is vast and involves numerous aspects, including network policies, ingress controllers, role-based access control (RBAC), admission controllers, and dedicated tools to scan the Kubernetes configurations, as well as runtime threat detection.\n\nHost OS Layer\nEven though containers provide a layer of isolation, it is important to mitigate the risks that the host OS may create, especially in a shared cloud-based environment, by ensuring it is compliant with standards such as CIS Benchmarks, HIPPA, etc. Infrastructure as Code tools such as Ansible can help you not only identify, but also mitigate risks by automatically and continuously updating the system configurations to match the security policy.\n\nCloud/VMs Infrastructure Layer\nSince we are considering cloud native applications, it is vital to consider cloud security. The cloud layer can be secured using VPCs, network ACLs, firewalls/security groups, IAM systems, etc.\n\n\n"},"lfs262-implementing-devsecops/what-is-devsecops/creating-and-implementing-devsecops-pipelines.html":{"url":"lfs262-implementing-devsecops/what-is-devsecops/creating-and-implementing-devsecops-pipelines.html","title":"Creating and Implementing DevSecOps Pipelines","keywords":"","body":"Creating and Implementing DevSecOps Pipelines\nDevSecOps Practices and Delivery Pipeline\nLet’s now learn how to put it all together and create a DevSecOps pipeline. Here we assume that:\n\nWe are dealing with a modern, cloud native application.\nThis application is being packaged as a container image.\nAnd it is being deployed with Kubernetes.\n\nDevOps Pipeline\nFirst, take a look at a simple continuous integration pipeline that you would begin with when you get started with DevOps practices. The following diagram illustrates some common components of a CI pipeline.\n\nComponents of a CI Pipeline\nThe goal of this pipeline is to provide instant, continuous feedback.\nPipeline Stages\n\nBuild\nThis stage notifies us whether the change in the application code breaks the build. In a collaborative environment, it is of utmost importance to ensure that the change introduced by one developer does not result in a build failure, causing everyone else’s work to be impacted, as they would not be able to test their changes due to compilation failure. This is generally the very first step in the CI pipeline. In case of an application which does not need compilation (e.g., Python, Node.js, which are interpreted languages), the build stage generally checks whether dependencies are being resolved and installed correctly.\n\nTest\nThe next stage in the continuous integration pipeline is to run unit tests. DevOps introduces the principle of shifting tests to the left side of the application delivery process. This reduces the rework, as well as the cost of detecting and mitigating issues. The earlier the problems are detected, the easier, quicker, and cheaper they are to fix.\n\nPackage\nAfter ensuring the code has gone through essential sanity checks, it is time to package the application into an artifact and prepare it to be distributed. Artifacts are generally pushed to a common repository, from where they are distributed further for deployment.\n\n\nA typical DevOps delivery pipeline would also include the deployment stages, but this is a simplistic depiction of how you start with continuous integration.\\\nWhat is clearly missing in this DevOps pipeline? The security checks! That is the whole reason why we are here, discussing DevSecOps. Let’s now look at how this pipeline can evolve into something that we can call a DevSecOps pipeline.\nComponents of a DevSecOps Pipeline\nLet’s say we took the same pipeline described in the previous subsection, ran some security magic, and converted it into a DevSecOps pipeline. How would it look like?\nThe following diagram depicts exactly such a pipeline that focuses on security at every stage of the delivery process.\n\nDevSecOps Pipeline Visualized\n \\\nLet’s analyze the additional security-related components of this pipeline. This is going to help you understand common DevSecOps practices.\nDevSecOps Practices\nCommon Security Practices to Embed into a DevSecOps Pipeline\n\nSecrets Scanning\nIt is important to ensure that no sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and cloud access credentials, are accidentally checked into the repository. Secrets scanners can be either run as pre-commit hooks (checks which are automatically run when a developer tries to commit to the repository) or can be enforced to run as the first step in the continuous integration pipeline, or both.\n\nSoftware Composition Analysis (SCA)\nA majority of API-based application software today uses open source, third-party components, including libraries and frameworks. This forms your supply chain. How secure are the components incorporated in your software? Are there any vulnerabilities that you must patch? What are the security implications of using these components? Software Composition Analysis (SCA) attempts to detect such risks and provides you with inputs on how to mitigate them.\n\nSoftware Bill of Materials (SBOM)\nThis relates to Software Component Analysis. Standards such as CycloneDX help you generate a list of components akin to a bill of materials and reports on which components are in use; with respective versions, licenses, known vulnerabilities, etc. This helps add transparency, as well as aids understanding of the security posture of your application infrastructure.\n\nStatic Application Security Testing (SAST)\nThe SAST stage helps you scan your application code and compare it against best practices, as well as detect any vulnerabilities in the code. This is a form of white box testing, whereas the tool being utilized has to be aware of the programming language being used and scan the code according to that. Like running unit tests, the goal here is to shift tests right, in this case within the context of security issues. The earlier the code issues are detected, the cheaper and faster it is to mitigate them.\n\nOSS License Checker\nThis stage is run as part of the DevSecOps pipeline to automatically detect the licenses for the components in use and compare it against the list of allowed licenses. As new components are added or existing components updated, there is a possibility of license terms being updated or new licenses being incorporated. This may have legal implications and can be incompatible with the organization’s policies. Having an automated process to detect such an event as part of the delivery pipeline is extremely useful.\n\nContainer Image Linting and Scanning\nAs increasingly more applications are being packaged and deployed as containers, what gets packaged along with your container as part of the artifact becomes an important security consideration. It is very common to use a base image from the registry which is outdated, unpatched and introduces many vulnerabilities. It is also a good idea to check if you are following best practices while building the container image itself. Container image linting and scanning provides the feedback on both aspects: how safe is the image along with all the packages in it, as well as how well is your Dockerfile written to build that image. Running these scans as part of an automated pipeline can be very handy.\n\nGitOps-Based Secure Deployment\nA commonly ignored part in the delivery process is deployment security. It is common to see a continuous integration platform such as Jenkins being provided with access to deployment systems with wider authorization, as well as to deployment systems provided to a wider audience. GitOps could help separate the deployment process from development and CI processes, keep the deployment code separate, and, at the same time, provide very limited access to systems such as Jenkins to trigger deployments only to limited applications. Since GitOps is built around Git-based workflows with support for pull requests, branching models, code reviews, etc., only the approved code is deployed to an environment.\n\nDynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)\nWhile SAST is a white box testing methodology, DAST takes a black box testing approach to detect security issues. Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) typically refers to automated penetration testing of web applications to detect issues wider than those present just in the application code. There could be multiple components which can form a chain of connections between a user and the application, which can be possibly exploited. This includes reverse proxies, network applications, caching services, databases, etc. To provide a holistic view of your application’s security posture, it is important to take an outsider’s view and simulate external attacks in addition to taking an insider’s view with SAST. DAST is run after the application has been deployed in a Dev/QA environment.\n\n\nWhile the practices described above form the core of the DevSecOps pipeline, it goes beyond this. DevSecOps is about taking a holistic approach and embedding security into all development and operational practices. This leads to additional processes, such as creating daily SecOps pipeline runs with compliance scans, using IDE plugins that detect security vulnerabilities, etc. True DevSecOps is about trying to follow the defense-in-depth approach. And despite following all these practices, it is important to acknowledge that you cannot guarantee 100% security, but the attempt is to get closer to it. And it is an iterative, continuous process!\nHow to Choose the Right Tools to Implement DevSecOps?\nSo far, you learned why DevSecOps is needed and explored the risks related to modern applications. By now, you also hopefully came to an agreement that including key DevSecOps practices is an important aspect of the delivery pipeline. Now, you should consider the following two questions: \"Which tools should you use?\" and \"How should you choose them?\". While there are many commercial as well as open source solutions for each of the practices we discussed while visualizing the DevSecOps pipeline, there are common criteria that you can use to shortlist the tools.\nTools included in the DevSecOps pipeline should be...\n\nAutomatable\nThey should have support for API-based communication or, at a minimum, a command line interface which can be used to script tasks.\n\nContainerized\nThey should support being packaged as a container application. This enables them to be integrated with the continuous integration systems which often run projects with container-based agents.\n\nFree from licensing limitations\nMany commercial applications have limitations on the number of scans, number of parallel scans, etc.\n\nConfigurable\nThis is helpful to counter false negatives/false positives.\n\n\nAlmost all tools recommended as part of this course are open source and available to use for free. However, you have to select the tools based on your application stack, organization goals, desired features, and availability of resources to maintain the tools.\n"},"lfs262-implementing-devsecops/what-is-devsecops/additional-resources-and-summary.html":{"url":"lfs262-implementing-devsecops/what-is-devsecops/additional-resources-and-summary.html","title":"Additional Resources and Summary","keywords":"","body":"Additional Resources and Summary\nAdditional Resources\nLearn more...\n\nRead the \"AWS-DevSecOps_Factory\" article on GitHub\nCheck out the OWASP API Security Top 10 list\nRead the \"Everything You Need to Know about API Security in 2021\" article, by Bernard Harguindeguy\nRead the \"Shift Left with AWS Codepipeline - Scanning every single code change\" article, by Avinash Jain\nWatch the videos available in the DevSecOps Learning playlist by Carnegie Mellon\n\nChapter Summary\nThis chapter should have helped you build a conceptual foundation about DevSecOps—why it is important, how it relates to the way modern, cloud native applications are designed, packaged and deployed, what are the risks introduced by such applications, and the methodology prescribed (this is where DevSecOps comes into play) to mitigate such risks.

With the evolution of open source software development and the use of frameworks and libraries, a significant portion of the codebase is from a third-party that forms part of the supply chain. This is where Software Component Analysis (SCA) comes into play.\nSCA refers to the methodology in which all components that make your software are analyzed for vulnerabilities and incompatible licenses. SCA also allows you to generate a bill of materials. This is helpful in understanding what your software consists of, as well as in providing a holistic risk profile.\nSCA Application - An Example\nTo better illustrate SCA, let’s take a look at the previously mentioned Equifax data breach that happened due to the Apache Struts vulnerability and explore possible solutions.\nEquifax Data Breach Example\n\nWhat is the problem?\nEighty percent of your application is made of components such as open source third-party libraries and frameworks.\nThese components allow for a shorter time to reach the market, increase efficiency, provide reusability, and are relatively more secure, as the code is being used widely, providing for faster detection and patching of these issues.\nHowever, many of these libraries are not updated or maintained, and have known vulnerabilities that are well-published and open to exploitation.\nMost organizations have no policy to control incorporation of components, update those components or resources allocated for application code changes on components being upgraded.\nMany open source applications are published under licenses which can conflict with the organization’s goals and cause serious problems.\n\n\nExample vulnerability: Struts remote code execution\nApache Struts 2 is a popular web framework, a new avatar of Struts Framework.\nStruts 2 was downloaded 1 million times by over 18,000 organizations in a year.\nA vulnerability in the library was found to be exploited, which could allow any arbitrary code to be executed on a Struts 2 web application.\n\n\nWhat is the solution?\nEnsuring your supply chain is safe requires a multi-pronged approach. Common risk factors related to the supply chain include:\n\nVulnerable components\\\nIf components have critical security vulnerabilities, they are going to impact your environment, resulting in security breaches, possibility of important data being stolen, etc.\nOutdated components\\\nMany of the well-known open source libraries, frameworks, etc., have Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that are open for anyone to explore and exploit. If any vulnerabilities are exposed, they are instantly patched, keeping these libraries and frameworks up-to-date. If there is no update policy in place, the software becomes susceptible to threats and attacks.\nComponents with incompatible licenses\\\nUsing components with incompatible licenses may have legal as well as financial consequences for an organization. Thus, it is important to have a policy that defines a list of allowed licenses.\nProvenance and traceability\\\nComponents with no auditable history of changes or with unknown authors can lead to various issues such as malicious code pretending to be a useful library getting incorporated into your software. That’s why it is imperative to be able to always trace and audit changes to the components.\n\n\n\n#\n\\\n"},"lfs262-implementing-devsecops/securing-the-supply-chain-with-sca/key-practices-to-mitigate-risks-and-ensure-safety-in-the-supply-chain.html":{"url":"lfs262-implementing-devsecops/securing-the-supply-chain-with-sca/key-practices-to-mitigate-risks-and-ensure-safety-in-the-supply-chain.html","title":"Key Practices to Mitigate Risks and Ensure Safety in the Supply Chain","keywords":"","body":"Key Practices to Mitigate Risks and Ensure Safety in the Supply Chain\nNext, we will discuss some measures (key practices) that can be introduced to mitigate these risks and ensure the safety of the supply chain.\n\nClose Solution 1: SCA\nIt is a good idea to run static scans not only on your own code, but also on all the components that your software uses. You may want to scan your code to perform:\n\nVulnerability analysis\\\nThis would help detect common vulnerabilities, which can then be followed by patching/upgrading of such components.\nOutdated component analysis\\\nThis is helpful to ensure that the libraries that you are using are well maintained and kept up-to-date.\nPedigree/Provenance analysis\\\nIt is important to know who wrote the software and its ancestry. Changes made to your components should be traceable and auditable.\n\nNOTE:\\\nStatic analysis of libraries is best thought of as providing hints regarding where security vulnerabilities might be located in the code. It is not a replacement for human expertise.\n\nClose Solution 2: SBOM\nGenerating a list of components and their details, such as versions, licenses, etc., helps build transparency. An SBOM is similar to the ingredients in a recipe. Some of the common standards for generating SBOM include:\n\nOWASP CycloneDX\nInternational Open Standard (ISO/IEC 5962:2021) - The Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX)\n\nOne tool that could help you generate an SBOM is the OWASP Dependency-Track.\nTo learn more about CycloneDX, see the following two articles: CycloneDX Use Cases and Guiding Principles.\n\nClose Solution 3: Analyze Component Licenses\nIt is important to know the licenses under which the components on which your application is dependent are published. Ignoring this could lead to legal implications for your organization and may conflict with the organizational goals and strategies. Moreover, the component licenses may get updated over time, making it important to define an allowed list of licenses acceptable to your organization and scan all the components regularly to ensure that no component violates the organization’s policy.\n\nClose Solution 4: Define an Open Source Policy\nYou must define and follow a clear policy on the inclusion and usage of open source software components. Some rules that you should consider include:\n\nRunning regular vulnerability scans (no critical CVEs).\nLimiting the age of components (e.g., no older than three years).\nRemoving unnecessary dependencies.\nEnsuring the use of high quality components.\nAutomating patching and updates.\nDedicating developer time for component management and updates.\n\n\n\nKey Practices\n"},"lfs262-implementing-devsecops/securing-the-supply-chain-with-sca/tools-to-implement-sca.html":{"url":"lfs262-implementing-devsecops/securing-the-supply-chain-with-sca/tools-to-implement-sca.html","title":"Tools to Implement SCA","keywords":"","body":"Tools to Implement SCA\nFollowing is a curated list of tools that could be useful to implement different aspects of Software Component Analysis, including vulnerability analysis, generating bill of materials, license checks, etc. All the tools listed here are open source and available free of cost, yet are very powerful.

Several interesting trends have emerged. Container images have become a widely accepted way of distributing software. Kubernetes has become the de facto standard for operating container clusters.

The annual Accelerate State of DevOps Report survey has indicated that high performing teams focus on rapid delivery of value to customers. It has become clear that the future of software delivery will include Kubernetes, Microservices and scripted pipeline-based workflows. Jenkins X is a step in this direction.

In simple words, these are the rules of thumb used by many successful organizations over a period of time. \nModern applications are built on many languages and tools. Software teams need mechanisms to integrate various changes frequently. Continuous Integration (CI) is a software practice that emphasizes continuous integration and validation of every single change. Various CI tools make it possible to automate CI processes. Continuous Delivery (CD), on the other hand, is the next logical step after Continuous Integration (CI). It focuses on automating the software delivery process in its entirety. By creating a pipeline-based workflow for different stages of the software delivery process, CD strives to standardize software delivery processes by removing manual errors. Together, CI and CD have made software delivery a first class citizen of the software development process and have increased the overall efficiency and reliability of the software release process.\nCI/CD tools provide implementations for CI/CD best practices. Some of the popular open source cloud-native CI/CD tools include Spinnaker, Argo CD, Tekton and Jenkins X. However, most of these tools do not check all the boxes when it comes to meeting the needs of a modern, fast-paced development organization. That’s where Jenkins X comes into play.\n"},"lfs268-ci-cd-with-jenkins-x/01-introduction-to-jenkins-x/what-is-jenkins-x.html":{"url":"lfs268-ci-cd-with-jenkins-x/01-introduction-to-jenkins-x/what-is-jenkins-x.html","title":"What Is Jenkins X","keywords":"","body":"What Is Jenkins X\nJenkins X is an open source tool for automating CI/CD workflow for the cloud native world. Its main focus is to achieve developer productivity through automation, tooling and DevOps best practices. Jenkins X is heavily influenced by the State of DevOps reports and the \"Accelerate: The Science of Lean Software and DevOps - Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organizations\" book by Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble and Gene Kim. In this book, the authors identified a number of capabilities of high performing software teams. Jenkins X provides an automated way of implementing those capabilities.\nJenkins X was launched in 2018 as a subproject of Jenkins - a wildly popular open source CI/CD tool. However, there are no real similarities between Jenkins and Jenkins X. Both are CI/CD servers but they have different approaches. Jenkins is a multi-faceted and multi-configurable tool that can run anywhere and can be configured to do multiple things, whereas Jenkins X is specifically designed for CI/CD of microservices-based architecture on Kubernetes. At the time of its inception, Jenkins X creators chose Jenkins as pipeline execution engine. As a result, Jenkinsfile-based pipelines could run on Jenkins X. That has now changed. Since April 2020, Tekton has replaced Jenkins as a pipeline execution engine. This means Tekton's YML-based pipelines are now the only way to create CI/CD workflows in Jenkins X.\nThe Jenkins X project is hosted by the Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF) - a hosted project of the Linux Foundation. You can find more information about CDF in the course \"Introduction\" chapter.\nJenkins X is a fast-moving project. At the time this course is being updated (November 2021), version 2.x is deprecated and 3.x is the major supported version. If you have used 2.x in the past, please refer to this document \"Comparison of Jenkins X version 3.x to 2.x\" for a comparison between these two versions. This class is based on features and capabilities of Jenkins 3.x.\n"},"lfs268-ci-cd-with-jenkins-x/01-introduction-to-jenkins-x/why-should-you-learn-jenkins-x.html":{"url":"lfs268-ci-cd-with-jenkins-x/01-introduction-to-jenkins-x/why-should-you-learn-jenkins-x.html","title":"Why Should You Learn Jenkins X?","keywords":"","body":"Why Should You Learn Jenkins X?\nSince its inception in 2014, Kubernetes has exploded in popularity. It has emerged as the operating system of the cloud. Software vendors are building the next generation of their products to be Kubernetes-native. As a result, a whole new eco-system of tools has emerged. However, building and operating software in Kubernetes can be challenging due to the overall complexity of Kuberbernets. Jenkins X allows us to harness the power of Kubernetes without spending endless hours on learning about the ever-growing Kubernetes features.\nAll businesses strive to quickly deliver new products and services to their customers. This increases customer satisfaction and enhances business profitability. CI/CD tools are also designed with a similar goal in mind - to quickly provide value. Monolithic applications are not well-suited for CI/CD. As a result, microservices-based applications are gaining popularity. More and more products are opting for loosely coupled architectures. And running container image-based production workloads is becoming a norm. Jenkins X is a promising open source CI/CD tool for cloud-native microservices.\nJenkins X takes an opinionated approach as it pre-defines many aspects of the software development process and makes decisions for you. It puts a strong focus on increasing developer's productivity. If you are starting on a new project, Jenkins X will create a directory structure and the required files for you. If you need a Kubernetes cluster with all tools installed and configured, no worries, Jenkins X will do that for you. But that's not all, it will also automatically create Git repositories, web hooks, and pipeline workflows for your project. If you don't like Jenkins X's opinionated approach, it will let you override the defaults and let you do your own thing. The list of what Jenkins X does is vast and is growing everyday.\n"},"lfs268-ci-cd-with-jenkins-x/01-introduction-to-jenkins-x/jenkins-x-capabilities.html":{"url":"lfs268-ci-cd-with-jenkins-x/01-introduction-to-jenkins-x/jenkins-x-capabilities.html","title":"Jenkins X Capabilities","keywords":"","body":"Jenkins X Capabilities\nJenkins X is founded on capabilities of high performing teams as defined in the \"Accelerate: The Science of Lean Software and DevOps - Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organizations\" book.\nJenkins X Capabilities\n\nUse version control for all artifacts\nJenkins X is inspired by GitOps - a term coined by Weaveworks. GitOps was originally created for Kubernetes cluster management. The main idea is to use Git as a single source of truth for all scripts and files needed to create and manage a cluster. Jenkins X advocates the same principle for CI/CD. All artifacts required to create CI/CD should reside in Git, and all changes should be made through Pull Requests.\n\nAutomate your Deployment process\nJenkins X focuses on automating the entire deployment process including the process of creating deployment environments. Production and Staging environments are created out of the box. Temporary preview environments can also be automatically created from Pull Requests.\n\nUse trunk-based development\nThe \"Accelerate: The Science of Lean Software and DevOps - Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organizations\" book concluded that software teams that use trunk-based development with short lived branches perform better. Trunk-based development is an SCM (Software Configuration Management) branching model where developers collaborate in a single branch called trunk or master in Git. The focus of this approach is to resist the temptation of creating long-lasting feature branches to avoid future merging problems. Jenkins X uses the same principle to implement CI/CD workflows.\n\n Implement Continuous Integration\nDevOps best practices recommend testing and validating a proposed source code change before merging to master. Jenkins X provides out of the box support for configuring source code repositories, a Serverless CI engine running inside a Kubernetes cluster to provide Continuous Integration.\n\n Implement Continuous Delivery\nDevOps best practices recommend that every commit should be tested and validated in a live environment and should always be ready for release into Production. Jenkins X automates many parts of a release pipeline. It helps you create and configure the toolchain required for continuous delivery.\n\n Use loosely-coupled architecture\nThe \"Accelerate: The Science of Lean Software and DevOps - Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organizations\" book has identified this as a key capability of high performing teams. Loosely-coupled architectures are lean, have less dependencies, have a single responsibility, and are easier to test and deploy. These qualities allow teams to work independently and release software quickly. Microservices are an excellent example of a loosely-coupled architecture. Jenkins X uses Kubernetes and other Kubernetes-based tools to achieve this capability. We will do a deep dive into Jenkins X architecture in the next chapter.\n\nArchitect for empowered teams\nCloud-native applications have given rise to polyglot developers as Microservices components can be created in Golang, Java, NodeJS, etc. Jenkins X makes it easier to create scripted pipelines for applications written in various languages. Apart from this, Jenkins X also provides many add-ons to extend its functionality. Add-ons are similar to plugins in Jenkins. For example, Grafana and Prometheus can be implemented as add-ons to provide CI/CD metrics collection and visualization.\n\n\n"},"lfs268-ci-cd-with-jenkins-x/02-building-blocks-of-jenkins-x/":{"url":"lfs268-ci-cd-with-jenkins-x/02-building-blocks-of-jenkins-x/","title":"02 Building Blocks of Jenkins X","keywords":"","body":"02 Building Blocks of Jenkins X\nOverview \nJenkins X provides an out-of-the-box CI/CD solution.

As a cluster manager, it strives to maintain the state of a cluster. This includes ensuring that the required number of resources is always running inside a cluster. Kubernetes state management is a declarative process achieved through configuration supplied via YAML or JSON files. These specification files are referred to as Kubernetes manifests or specs.\n \n\n \nKubernetes uses a declarative model for cluster management. It diligently works to ensure that the set and state of objects running inside the cluster matches with the set and state of objects defined in the manifest. Kubernetes controllers help watch the state of a cluster then make or request changes if needed. Kubernetes uses objects to abstract the state of a cluster. A full-blown discussion of Kubernetes is outside the scope of this class. Please see Kubernetes Documentation to learn more about it.\nKubernetes Objects\n\nPods\nIn Kubernetes, a Pod is the smallest deployment unit that represents the number of processes running inside a cluster. A Pod includes an application container, storage resources, network identity, and options that govern a container runtime. A Pod can run one or many containers. Docker is the most common container runtime used in a Kubernetes Pod.\n\nDeployment\nA Deployment provides a way of creating Pods via declarative manifests. You define the requirements of your application state in a YAML file and use Kubernetes API to communicate the state to the deployment controller. The controller creates Pods as defined by your configuration.\n\nServices\nApplications running inside a Pod are not visible outside of a Kubernetes cluster. Services provide a way to expose these applications to the outside world. Besides, Kubernetes Pods are ephemeral. Old Pods are removed and new ones are created frequently. Services ensure that users can reach newly created Pods without making any config changes on the cluster. In this sense, Services are responsible for continuous access to applications running inside a Kubernetes cluster.\n\nNamespaces\nKubernetes supports running multiple virtual clusters on a single physical cluster. Namespaces provide this functionality and are intended for multi-user environments. They provide ways to divide cluster resources between multiple teams.\n\nVolumes\nKubernetes Pods are ephemeral but the data used by them may need to be persisted for a longer period of time. Also, containers in the Pod might need to share the data. Kubernetes Volumes help manage the data needs of the Pods. Kubernetes supports multiple volume types. To learn more about Kubernetes Volumes see Kubernetes Documentation.\n\nIngress\nKubernetes Ingress exposes HTTP and HTTPS routes from outside the cluster to services running inside the cluster. It can also be used for load balancing, terminating SSL/TLS, and name-based virtual hosting.\n\n\nJenkins X tools run as Kubernetes pods inside a Kubernetes cluster and work together to provide a CI/CD workflow. Setting and using Jenkins X does not require extensive knowledge of Kubernetes. However, having a solid grasp of it can be very useful as you try to further extend and scale your Jenkins X cluster.\n"},"lfs268-ci-cd-with-jenkins-x/02-building-blocks-of-jenkins-x/helm.html":{"url":"lfs268-ci-cd-with-jenkins-x/02-building-blocks-of-jenkins-x/helm.html","title":"Helm","keywords":"","body":"Helm\nHelm\nHelm is a package manager for Kubernetes. Helm charts help define, install, upgrade, and rollback even the most complex Kubernetes applications. A Helm chart includes deployment, service, config maps, etc. It is templated so the variables can be easily manipulated. Application dependencies can also be managed via Helm.\nJenkins X uses Helm to package and deploy applications inside a Kubernetes cluster.\nHelmfile\nHelmfile is a declarative specification for creating Helm charts. Jenkins X uses helmfiles to install, upgrade and configure Helm charts.\nKuberhealthy\nKuberhealthy is a monitoring operator for Kubernetes. It lets you create your own tests and integrates seamlessly with tools like Prometheus and InfluxDB.\nJenkins X uses Kuberhealthy to monitor itself.\nTekton\nTekton, formerly known as Knative pipelines, is an extension built on Kubernetes for creating cloud-native CI/CD workflow. It allows you to use tools of your choice to build container images. Pipeline runs are executed in containers and can scale on-demand to meet increased demand. Tekton can deploy applications to multiple platforms including serverless, virtual machines and Kubernetes clusters.\nTekton is the pipeline execution engine of Jenkins X. At the run time, Jenkins X pipelines are converted into Tekton resources and are executed inside a Kubernetes cluster.\nLighthouse\nLighthouse is a lightweight ChatOps-based webhook handler to execute Jenkins X pipelines on webhooks for multiple Git providers such as GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab, etc.\nLighthouse is created by Jenkins X team to overcome Prow’s inability to work with SCM tools other than GitHub.\nSkaffold\nSkaffold is a tool that makes Kubernetes deployments easy and repeatable. Skaffold will build a Docker image, push it to a registry, and deploy it to a Kubernetes cluster. It watches the local source code directory and rebuilds and redeploys automatically whenever the source code changes.\nJenkins X uses Skaffold to build Docker images. Jenkins X DevPods use Skaffold for doing incremental builds on source code changes.\nKaniko\nKaniko is a tool used to build container images from a Dockerfile. Kaniko does not use Docker daemon and can be used to build images securely.\nKpt\nKpt is used to create declarative workflows based on configuration files. It's also used to update, validate and apply Kubernetes configurations.\nOctant\nOctant is used to visualize Kubernetes workloads. Jenkins X uses it as a plugin for creating a visualization console.\nTerraform\nTerraform is an Infrastructure as Code tool for creating vendor-agnostic infrastructure in various public clouds. Jenkins X uses Terraform to provision Kubernetes clusters in various public clouds.\nJenkins\nJenkins is a very popular CI tool. Jenkins X provides interoperability with Jenkins. To learn more about Jenkins, enroll in the Introduction to Jenkins (LFS167x) and Jenkins Essentials (LFS267) courses.\nNexus\nNexus is an open source binary artifact management tool which stores and manages versioned build artifacts.

Next, while Prow/Lighthouse listeners are waiting for SCM events, they:\n\nListen to Git webhooks\nImplement Git ChatOps commands\nDispatch webhook requests to Jenkins X Pipeline controller\nReport the status of pipeline builds to SCM.\n\nAlternatively, Jenkins X also provides a command line tool called JX to interact with tooling components. For example, you can use the jx quickstart command to create a Jenkins X CI/CD flow. You can also use JX CLI to import a pre-existing project into Jenkins X. We will further explore this functionality in the subsequent chapters.\nJenkins X pipeline controller creates Tekton tasks and pipelines based on the Jenkins X YAML definition. Tekton is the pipeline execution engine and it does the following: \n\nDefines pipelines for each project/repository\nDefines steps for each of the pipelines\nExecutes pipelines for each build/commit\nStores artifacts in registries\nDeploys application into permanent/temporary environments.\n\nKubernetes provides the runtime environment for Jenkins X.

Please follow the instructions here to install it on your preferred choice of operating system.\n#\n"},"lfs268-ci-cd-with-jenkins-x/03-installing-jenkins-x/installing-jenkins-x.html":{"url":"lfs268-ci-cd-with-jenkins-x/03-installing-jenkins-x/installing-jenkins-x.html","title":"Installing Jenkins X","keywords":"","body":"Installing Jenkins X\nInstalling JX and kubectl Command Line Tool\nJX is a command line tool for installing and operating Jenkins X. It provides an API to interact with the underlying Kubernetes cluster, and allows you to create and export your software projects into Jenkins X. It also lets you interact with your pipelines and promote your applications to various environments. Not only that, if you don't have a working Kubernetes cluster, JX will help you create one.\nYou can find the latest stable JX releases on GitHub.\nJX can be installed on Windows, MacOS and Linux. An installation process is very straightforward and can be accomplished with just a few commands.\nHere is an example of how to install JX on Linux:\nStart by downloading the latest version of the binary on your machine:\ncurl -L htt‌ps://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/releases/download/v3.2.182/jx-linux-amd64.tar.gz | tar xzv\\\nchmod +x jx\nMove the JX binary to a location in your executable path:\nsudo mv jx /usr/local/bin\nYou can verify your installed version by typing the following command:\njx --version\nPlease refer to Jenkins X Documentation for instructions on how to install the JX tool on other operating systems.\nKubernetes command line tool kubectl is also required to run commands on your Jenkins X Kubernetes cluster. Please use the following command to install the latest version of kubectl on Linux OS:\ncurl -LO \"ht‌tps://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s ht‌tps://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl\" sudo install -o root -g root -m 0755 kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl\nFinally, test the version of a binary:\nkubectl version --client\nPlease refer to kubectl Documentation for installation instructions on Windows and Mac OS platforms.\nSetting Up a Kubernetes Cluster\nA functional Kubernetes cluster is also required for Jenkins X installation. Jenkins X supports many vendor-provided clusters including GKE, AKS, EKS, OpenShift, etc. Moreover, Jenkins X can also be installed on on-premise Kubernetes clusters and on minikube. If you have a functional cluster in your private cloud, you should be able to install Jenkins X in that environment too. Setting up a private Kubernetes cluster is beyond the scope of this course.\nIn this chapter, we will use the Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) platform to create a Kubernetes cluster and install Jenkins X on that cluster. If applicable, GCP free tier can be used for this installation. For the lab exercises, we will use minikube to create a local Kubernetes cluster and install Jenkins X in it, but you can use any vendor-based Kubernetes cluster to complete the exercises.\nWe will also need a gcloud binary tool to set up command line connectivity with a GCP account. This tool is installed as part of the Google Cloud SDK.\nIn addition, we will need Terraform, a popular Infrastructure as Code tool. Jenkins X leverages Terraform to manage vendor-specific installation details.\\\nGitOps Repositories\nJenkins X follows GitOps principles for installing and operating Jenkins X. As part of the requirements, we will start by creating a dedicated organization in GitHub. It is highly recommended that you use a GitHub organization and not your personal repository to avoid problems with ChatOps and automated webhook creation.\nYou will also need a bot user with a personal access token for accessing newly created infrastructure repositories. Ideally this bot user should be different from your personal user. Once you are logged in to your GitHub account, you can click here to create a personal access token. Finally, invite the new bot user to be a part of the Jenkins X organization. This will grant Jenkins X access to all repositories that belong to this organization.\nAs part of the installation process, two repositories will be created:\n\nInfrastructure repository\nCluster repository\n\nAll infrastructure-related artifacts will be stored inside the first repository. Terraform will use this repository to create the cluster in Google Cloud. All cluster specific artifacts, e.g. secrets and Helm charts will be stored inside cluster repository.\nJenkins X provides templates for these repositories. Templates help create server-side clones of the repositories. Below are the URLs for the template repositories:\n\nhtt‌ps://github.com/jx3-gitops-repositories/jx3-terraform-gke/generate\nhttps://github.com/jx3-gitops-repositories/jx3-gke-gsm/generate\n\nNOTE: You can generate these repositories from the web browser. Please ensure that you are already logged into your GitHub account and choose the newly created organization as the user for these repositories.\nAs a next step, please clone these repositories into your local working directory. You will modify the values.auto.tfvars file located inside the jx3-terraform-gke directory. Next, you need to add a couple of new entries. First, you will add the URL of the cluster repository. Next, you will add the name of the GCP project to be used for this cluster. This project needs to be active before you create your cluster. Finally, you will add a flag to indicate that you are using Google secret manager to store the secrets. Jenkins X also supports the Hashicorp Vault secret manager. If you want to use it, you will need to generate an appropriate repository first. Use this link to generate a vault secrets repository.\nThe modified values.auto.tfvars file will look similar to this:\nresource_labels = { \"provider\" : \"jx\" }\njx_git_url = \"htt‌ps://github.com/orgName/jx3-gke/gsm\"\ngcp_project = \"my-gcp-project\"\ngsm = true\nMake sure your changes are committed to Git and pushed to the master infrastructure repository.\nBefore we start installation, we need to make sure that the gcloud binary is configured to talk to the GCP project we have defined inside the values.auto.tfvars file. The following command will list all the valid configurations and a true flag will indicate the active configuration:\ngcloud config configurations list\nWe also need to set GitHub user and access token as environment variables so Terraform can use them during the installation:\nexport TF_VAR_jx_bot_username=my-bot-username\nexport TF_VAR_jx_bot_token=my-bot-token\nLet’s create a Kubernetes cluster and install Jenkins X with all its components inside this cluster. Following commands should be executed sequentially:\nterraform init\nterraform plan\nterraform apply\nJenkins X installation can be verified by running the following commands:\njx ns js\njx verify install\nFinally, you can launch the UI console by running:\njx ui\nThis will open Octant UI in a browser window and you can verify newly created Jenkins X environments.\nAt this point, we have successfully completed installation of Jenkins X running in GKE, and we are ready to create projects.\nUpgrading Jenkins X\nThere are three components that we need to upgrade:\n\njx binary aka Jenkins CLI client\nJenkins X cluster\nKubernetes infrastructure\n\njx binary upgrade: Jenkins X CLI client should be periodically upgraded.\nThe following command can be used to upgrade the client:\njx upgrade cli\nTo upgrade jx subcommand plugins run:\njx upgrade plugins\nFor more information on CLI upgrade, please refer to Jenkins X upgrade Documentation.\nJenkins X cluster upgrade: Jenkins X cluster can be upgraded automatically or manually. Let's look at each of these options.\nAutomatic upgrade: Automatic upgrades can be enabled by updating the jx-requirements.yml file located in your cluster development directory:\napiVersion: core.jenkins-x.io/v4beta1\\\nkind: Requirements\\\nspec:\\\n  autoUpdate:\\\n    enabled: true\\\n    schedule: “0 0 * * *”\\\n    autoMerge: true\nThe above configuration will automatically upgrade at midnight. Jenkins X runs the upgrade as part of a pipeline run. If the autoMerge option is set to true, Jenkins X will automatically merge the pull request to finish the upgrade.\nAutomatic upgrades may not be practical for most of us. Thankfully there is also an option to perform manual upgrades.\nManual upgrade: The manual upgrade can be triggered by running a command in your development cluster repository. Before launching the upgrade, please ensure your local directory is in sync with the remote repository and all local changes are pushed to the remote:\njx gitops upgrade\nThe above command does the following:\n\nUpgrades your local version stream to the latest.\nApplies any changes in the version stream to the boot job and its configuration.\nCreates a pull request in your development environment repository containing all the above changes.\n\nThe pull request will run the development master pipeline in your cluster to apply the upgrade. You can view the upgrade log by running the following command:\njx admin logs\nKubernetes infrastructure upgrade: Kubernetes configuration is stored inside the infrastructure Git repository and Terraform is used to deploy these changes. Make sure you update values.auto.tfvars file with intended changes and run the following Terraform commands to upgrade your Kubernetes cluster:\nexport TF_VAR_jx_bot_username=[your bot username]\nexport TF_VAR_jx_bot_token=[your bot token]\nterraform get -update\nterraform plan\nterraform apply\n\nAdditional Resources\nTo learn more, we recommend that you take a look at the following resources:\n\n“Amazon: Setup Jenkins X on EKS on AWS”\n“OpenShift: Setup Jenkins X on an Existing OpenShift Cluster”\n“Azure: Setup Jenkins X on Azure”\n“jx: Command Line Interface Reference”\n“On-Premises: Setup Jenkins X on Vanilla Kubernetes”\n”Jenkins X Capabilities Matrix”\n\n"},"lfs268-ci-cd-with-jenkins-x/03-installing-jenkins-x/installing-jenkins-x-in-gcp.html":{"url":"lfs268-ci-cd-with-jenkins-x/03-installing-jenkins-x/installing-jenkins-x-in-gcp.html","title":"Installing Jenkins X in GCP","keywords":"","body":"Installing Jenkins X in GCP\n"},"lfs268-ci-cd-with-jenkins-x/04-creating-jenkins-x-projects/":{"url":"lfs268-ci-cd-with-jenkins-x/04-creating-jenkins-x-projects/","title":"04 Creating Jenkins X Projects","keywords":"","body":"04 Creating Jenkins X Projects\nJenkins X CI/CD setup is fairly easy.

The pipeline workflow can also promote applications from one environment to another. For example, a successful pipeline run can promote application from staging to production environment.\n\\\n"},"lfs268-ci-cd-with-jenkins-x/04-creating-jenkins-x-projects/chatops-with-jenkins-x.html":{"url":"lfs268-ci-cd-with-jenkins-x/04-creating-jenkins-x-projects/chatops-with-jenkins-x.html","title":"ChatOps with Jenkins X","keywords":"","body":"ChatOps with Jenkins X\nJenkins X is based on the GitOps set of practices for the Kubernetes cluster management—every change must be recorded in Git and Git should initiate events that change the cluster. The developers communicate with each other through Git pull requests (PR) comments, making PRs the cornerstone of Jenkins X pipelines. ChatOps, however, takes that communication to the next level. With ChatOps, developers can type commands in chat windows resulting in automation runs. For example, typing “/approve” in the PR chat window will result in approving and auto-merging of a pull request.\nJenkins X lets you assign collaborators for a project. It automatically creates a file called OWNERS as soon as you import or create a new Jenkins X project.\napprovers:\\\n- hgautam\\\nreviewers:\\\n- hgautam\nAs you can see, this file is divided into two sections - approvers and reviewers. You can add multiple collaborators to this file and they can use ChatOps commands to approve and run automatic workflows.

It provides a way of creating an application based on pre-created samples. The Jenkins X team has created a curated list of sample applications that can be quickly imported into Git. Every time you run a Quickstart, Jenkins X matches the correct build pack for the language of your application and this build pack does the rest - compiles, tests and deploys the application. Jenkins X Quickstarts are stored in this GitHub organization.\nIf you are just starting out with Jenkins X, Quickstart is the best option to see Jenkins X’s capabilities. You can start with the following command:\njx project quickstart\nPlease note that Quickstarts can be filtered based on the programming languages. For example, if you want to list Golang Quickstarts, you can run the following command:\njx project quickstart -l go\nAlternatively, you can use text-based filter like this:\njx project quickstart -f http\nAfter executing one of the above commands, you will see the list of available Quickstarts. It will be similar to the following:\njx project quickstart\nThe following steps will be executed as part of the jx project quickstart command:\\\n\nA new application will be created in a subdirectory on your computer.\nAn application source code will be added to a Git repository.\nA remote Git repository will be created on a Git server, such as GitHub.\nYour application code will be pushed to a remote GitHub repository.\nThe following default config files will be added:\\\n- A Dockerfile to build your application as a Docker image.\\\n- Tekton steps and triggers to create a CI/CD pipeline.\\\n- A Helm chart to deploy your application in the Kubernetes cluster.\nA webhook will be registered on the remote Git repository that triggers Tekton pipelines.\nThe first pipeline run will be triggered.\n\n"},"lfs268-ci-cd-with-jenkins-x/04-creating-jenkins-x-projects/using-jx-project-import.html":{"url":"lfs268-ci-cd-with-jenkins-x/04-creating-jenkins-x-projects/using-jx-project-import.html","title":"Using jx project import","keywords":"","body":"Using jx project import\nWhat if you already have a working application and want to run CI/CD with Jenkins X?
